# NLP : Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is an analytical method for identifying the emotional content of communications. It combines machine learning, natural language processing, and statistics.

Businesses assess content such as social media posts, online reviews, call centre interactions, and consumer messaging using sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis can monitor shifts in opinions about certain businesses, goods or services, or aspects of those goods or services.
